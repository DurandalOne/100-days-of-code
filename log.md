# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** My first day of the 100 Days of Code challenge. I'm currently studying Computer Science through the Open University and am working through modules on Python and Java. After my 7th grueling Christmas period in retail I've decided I want a career change before next Christmas and before I finish my degree (which will be another 2 years). I'm working though a Python masterclass on Udemy, today it's been a challenge to split any given IP address into segments and to state how long the segment is using flow control.
