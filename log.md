# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked lectures 30-37 of the Udemy course Complete Python Masterclass; read through more of current OU unit on algorithms using Python

**Thoughts:** My first day of the 100 Days of Code challenge. I'm currently studying Computer Science through the Open University and am working through modules on Python and Java. After my 7th grueling Christmas period in retail I've decided I want a career change before next Christmas and before I finish my degree (which will be another 2 years). I'm working though a Python masterclass on Udemy, today it's been a challenge to split any given IP address into segments and to state how long the segment is using flow control.

### Day 2: January 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked lectures 38-46 of the Udemy course Complete Python Masterclass; completed a couple of challenges on flow control and lists

**Thoughts:** My hour of coding has turned into 10 hours of learning and reading various materials. Worked on more Python today, more lectures on Udemy. I found the basics of flow control quite interesting and enjoyed a challenge invoving wrting a number guessing game using loops. Added a bit more to the code then was requied to make it seem like more of an actual game.

### Day 3: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Not much actual coding was done, rather lots of studying algoritms and data structures

**Thoughts:** My original aim today was to pivot and spend some time brusing up on my Java. Instead I spent most of my day off concentrating on the nitty gritty of sorting. I read up on native sorting (such as bubble, selection and insertion); the complexity of straight sorting algorithms; reduction and recursion; smart sorting and finally how it all fits into the Big-O. It was a lot to take in, but I think I manged to pick most of it up.

### Day 4: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Sidestepped from Python over to Java for some Open University work

**Thoughts:** Gave my Python work a bit of a break and started work on my next piece of work for my Java Open University work. One task is to create a class in Java called Rocket. The class has to dispay a rocket made of a triangle, square and circle on a GUI and "set the rocket off" adjusting the x and y positions as the rocket moves up.

### Day 5: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Chipping away at more OU work

**Thoughts:** Not had the largest amount of time to work on loads of code. The time I did have though was spent on more of my Java open university work. Worked on the rocket problem from yesterday and another problem in which I have to link various frog classes to one another.
