# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked lectures 30-37 of the Udemy course Complete Python Masterclass; read through more of current OU unit on algorithms using Python

**Thoughts:** My first day of the 100 Days of Code challenge. I'm currently studying Computer Science through the Open University and am working through modules on Python and Java. After my 7th grueling Christmas period in retail I've decided I want a career change before next Christmas and before I finish my degree (which will be another 2 years). I'm working though a Python masterclass on Udemy, today it's been a challenge to split any given IP address into segments and to state how long the segment is using flow control.

### Day 2: January 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked lectures 38-46 of the Udemy course Complete Python Masterclass; completed a couple of challenges on flow control and lists

**Thoughts:** My hour of coding has turned into 10 hours of learning and reading various materials. Worked on more Python today, more lectures on Udemy. I found the basics of flow control quite interesting and enjoyed a challenge invoving wrting a number guessing game using loops. Added a bit more to the code then was requied to make it seem like more of an actual game.
